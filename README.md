# Browser History
Dumps the browser history info on a machine

## Overview

This will enumerate all of the profiles on a machine and parse the history/cookies/etc for each known browser profile.
The initial goal is to do this for Firefox/Chrome on Windows/Mac/Linux with additional support for more browsers later.
I also plan to support multiple output formats but will start with a sqlite database I think and eventually have
CSVs, JSON, etc.
